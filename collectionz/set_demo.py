"""
MUTABLE
Set is also similar to a list, except it is unordered. It can store heterogeneous data and it is mutable. We create a set by enclosing our data with curly brackets ‘{}’.
Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).
set cannot have mutable elements like lists, sets or dictionaries as its elements.

Frozenset is a new class that has the characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned.
While tuples are immutable lists, frozensets are immutable sets.
